    <h2> How is Pasta made? </h2>
    
    <p>Pasta products are produced by mixing milled wheat, water, eggs (for egg noodles or egg spaghetti), and sometimes optional ingredients. These ingredients are typically added to a continuous, high capacity auger extruder, which can be equipped with a variety of dies that determine the shape of the pasta.

    <h2> Why is pasta so popular? </h2>
    <p>In addition to be being delicious and affordable, pasta has also a long shelf life, and it should be good for a few years as long as it's kept in a dry, clean place. So, to recap: pasta is delicious, healthy, cheap, and practical, since it can be kept in storage over a long period of time.</p>
